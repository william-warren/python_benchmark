        Im just retarded so thats why this is all I have.  
        ...What a lovely day.

        Basically cloned the correct repo, then somehow managed to open the wrong directory in vscode, 
        hence why I'm retarded,  and the directory I opened was the old python benchmark directory, 
        so I did not have the concert tickets folder in it at all, and just started working on every other
        benchmark instead.  So yep.  Didn't realize that I had the wrong directory opened until thirty minutes
        into the last block, but by that point I no longer had sufficient time to complete the benchmark.

        P.S.
            Im pretty confident I could complete it in around 30 minutes or so and at most within a block, however to 
            do that I have to be in a good state of mind and as you can imagine I was immensely pissed off with myself
            at the time of writing this so the chances of me being able to work with a clear head and the most efficiency 
            practically dissipated.  Hence why I did not even attempt it.
